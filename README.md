[![Docker Tests](https://github.com/bryangrimes/doit/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bryangrimes/doit/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml)

DoIt is a minimalist todo list manager for Neovim, designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind. It provides a clean, distraction-free interface to manage your tasks directly within Neovim.

DoIt is my personal way of how I want to track my tasks and todos. As a Principal Engineer, I have a lot of things to keep track of, and I wanted a simple way to do that without leaving my editor. I've tried a lot of todo list managers, and they all seem to be too much for me. I just want to keep track of what I need to do, and that's it. I don't need a bunch of bells and whistles. I just need to know what I need to do.

I also wanted a sandbox to play with Lua and some docker ideas around containerized Neovim plugin development and testing.  Oh also I'm dabbling some with Claude Code in this repo, to see how AI can help me learn a new-ish language...so that's something.   Anyway, here we are.

If you want to contribute or have any ideas, feel free to open an issue or make a PR. I don't know why you would, but hey, I'm not here to judge.  Cheers!

> This project is 100% built on top of [Dooing](https://github.com/atiladefreitas/dooing) by [atiladefreitas](https://github.com/atiladefreitas). DoIt is a fork with some heavy modifications for customizations for how I work, while maintaining the core functionality.

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Neovim `>= 0.10.0`
- [Lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) as your plugin manager

### Using Lazy.nvim

```lua
return {
    "bryangrimes/doit",
    config = function()
        require("doit").setup({
            -- optional configurations here...
        })
    end,
}
```

`:Lazy sync` to install and sync the plugin, or relaunch Neovim.

### Default Configuration

DoIt comes with sensible defaults that you can customize as you like.  Defaults:

```lua
{
    save_path = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/doit_todos.json",  -- Data storage path
    timestamp = {
        enabled = true,         -- Show relative timestamps (e.g., @5m ago, @2h ago)
    },
    window = {
        width = 55,             -- Width of the floating window
        height = 20,            -- Height of the floating window
        border = 'rounded',     -- Border style
        position = 'center',    -- Window position: 'right', 'left', 'top', 'bottom', 'center',
                                    -- 'top-right', 'top-left', 'bottom-right', 'bottom-left'
        padding = {
            top = 1,
            bottom = 1,
            left = 2,
            right = 2,
        },

}
```

## Commands

DoIt provides several commands to get things done:

- `:doit` - Opens the main window
- `:doit add [text]` - Adds a new task
  - `-p, --priorities [list]` - Comma-separated list of priorities (e.g. "important,urgent")
- `:doit list` - Lists all todos with their indices and metadata
- `:doit set [index] [field] [value]` - Modifies todo properties
  - `priorities` - Set/update priorities (use "nil" to clear)
  - `ect` - Set estimated completion time (e.g. "30m", "2h", "1d", "0.5w")
