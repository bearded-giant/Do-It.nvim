1. doit                                                        *doit-intro*

Do-It.nvim is a minimalist todo list manager for Neovim, designed with simplicity and
efficiency in mind. It provides a clean, distraction-free interface to manage
your tasks directly within Neovim.

Do-It.nvim is my personal way of how I want to track my tasks and todos. As a 
Principal Engineer, I have a lot of things to keep track of, and I wanted a 
simple way to do that without leaving my editor. I've tried a lot of todo list 
managers, and they all seem to be too much for me. I just want to keep track of 
what I need to do, and that's it. I don't need a bunch of bells and whistles. 
I just need to know what I need to do.

Do-It.nvim is 100% built on top of Dooing by atiladefreitas. Do-It.nvim is a fork with 
some heavy modifications for customizations for how I work, while maintaining 
the core functionality.

FEATURES                                                      *doit-features*

- Manage to-dos in a simple and efficient way
- Categorize tasks with #tags
- Simple task management with clear visual feedback
- Persistent storage of your to-dos
- Adapts to your Neovim colorscheme
- Compatible with Lazy.nvim for effortless installation

- To-do reordering with customizable keybindings
- In-progress (active) to-dos automatically float to the top of the list and sort by priority
- Quick list view of active to-dos with auto-refresh
- Lualine integration to show your top active to-do
- Project-specific notes for documenting your work
- Multiple todo lists with easy switching and moving items between lists

REQUIREMENTS                                              *doit-requirements*

- Neovim >= 0.10.0
- Lazy.nvim as your plugin manager

INSTALLATION                                              *doit-installation*

Using Lazy.nvim: >lua
    return {
        "bearded-giant/do-it.nvim",
        config = function()
            require("doit").setup({
                -- your configuration here
            })
        end,
    }
<

Then run `:Lazy sync` to install and sync the plugin, or relaunch Neovim.

CONFIGURATION                                            *doit-configuration*

Do-It.nvim uses a nested configuration structure that separates core framework
settings from module-specific options. This organization makes the configuration
easier to navigate and understand.

Configuration Structure Overview:
>lua
    {
        -- Core framework settings (top level)
        development_mode = false,
        quick_keys = true,
        timestamp = { enabled = true },
        lualine = { enabled = true, max_length = 30 },
        project = {
            enabled = true,
            detection = {
                use_git = true,
                fallback_to_cwd = true,
            },
        },
        
        -- Module configurations
        modules = {
            todos = {
                enabled = true,
                default_list = "default",  -- Name of the default list to load on startup
                ui = {
                    window = {
                        width = 55,
                        height = 20,
                        border = "rounded",
                        position = "center",
                    },
                    -- list_window, calendar, scratchpad...
                },
                formatting = {
                    pending = { icon = "○" },
                    in_progress = { icon = "◐" },
                    done = { icon = "✓" },
                },
                priorities = {
                    { name = "critical", weight = 16 },
                    { name = "urgent", weight = 8 },
                    { name = "important", weight = 4 },
                },
                storage = {
                    save_path = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/doit_todos.json",
                    import_export_path = vim.fn.expand("~/todos.json"),
                },
                keymaps = {
                    toggle_window = "<leader>td",
                    new_todo = "i",
                    -- ... all todo keymaps
                },
            },
            notes = {
                enabled = true,
                ui = {
                    window = {
                        -- Absolute sizing (in columns/lines)
                        width = 80,
                        height = 30,
                        -- Or relative sizing (percentage)
                        relative_width = 0.6,
                        relative_height = 0.6,
                        use_relative = true,  -- Toggle between modes
                        position = "center",  -- center, top-left, etc.
                        border = "rounded",
                        title = " Notes ",
                        title_pos = "center",
                    },
                    icons = {
                        note = "📓",
                        linked = "🔗",
                    },
                },
                storage = {
                    path = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/doit/notes",
                    mode = "project",  -- "global" or "project"
                },
                keymaps = {
                    toggle = "<leader>dn",
                    close = "q",
                    switch_mode = "m",
                },
            },
        },
    }
<

Key Configuration Points:

- Core settings (top level): Framework-wide configurations
- Module settings (modules.todos and modules.notes): Module-specific options
- UI configurations are nested under each module's `ui` table
- Storage paths and options are under each module's `storage` table
- Keymaps are module-specific and found in each module's `keymaps` table

Notes Window Sizing:~

The notes module supports flexible window sizing:
- Absolute: Set `width` and `height` in columns/lines
- Relative: Set `relative_width` and `relative_height` as percentages (0.0-1.0)
- Toggle: Use `use_relative = true/false` to switch between modes
- Position: Choose from center, top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right

For a complete list of all configuration options with detailed descriptions,
see the file `lua/doit/config.lua` in the plugin directory.

Legacy Configuration:~

The plugin maintains backward compatibility with the flat configuration
structure. Legacy options at the root level will still work but are deprecated
in favor of the nested structure.
                name = "urgent",
                weight = 2,
            },
        },
        priority_groups = {
            high = {
                members = { "important", "urgent" },
                color = nil,
                hl_group = "DiagnosticError",
            },
            medium = {
                members = { "important" },
                color = nil,
                hl_group = "DiagnosticWarn",
            },
            low = {
                members = { "urgent" },
                color = nil,
                hl_group = "DiagnosticInfo",
            },
        },
        hour_score_value = 1/8,
    }

PRIORITY SYSTEM                                             *doit-priorities*

Configure priorities and their weights: >lua
    priorities = {
        { name = "critical", weight = 16 },
        {
            name = "urgent",
            weight = 8,
        },
        {
            name = "important",
            weight = 4,
        },
    },
    priority_groups = {
        critical = {
            members = { "critical" },
            color = "#FF0000",
        },
        high = {
            members = { "urgent" },
            color = nil,
            hl_group = "DiagnosticError",
        },
        medium = {
            members = { "important" },
            color = nil,
            hl_group = "DiagnosticWarn",
        },
    }
<

Sorting by Priority~
1. In-progress (active) todos are always displayed at the top
2. When multiple in-progress todos exist, they're sorted by priority (critical, then urgent, then important)
3. All other todos follow the standard sorting (priority, due date, creation time)

Note: Each todo can have only one priority assigned.

TODO LISTS                                                    *doit-lists*

Do-It.nvim supports multiple todo lists, allowing you to organize tasks by
project, context, or any category you prefer.

Features:
- Create multiple named lists (e.g., "work", "personal", "daily")
- Switch between lists with the list manager (L or :DoItLists)
- Move individual todos between lists while preserving their status
- Configure a default list to load on startup
- Each list maintains its own todos and metadata

Managing Lists:~
Press L in the main todo window to open the list manager where you can:
- Create new lists
- Switch to a different list (automatically opens that list)
- Rename existing lists
- Delete lists (except the active one)
- Preview list contents and statistics

Moving Todos Between Lists:~
1. Select a todo in the main window
2. Press m to open the list selector
3. Use j/k or arrow keys to navigate
4. Press <CR> to move the todo to the selected list
5. The todo retains its status (pending/in-progress/done)

Configuration:~
Set a default list to load on startup: >lua
    require("doit").setup({

PROJECT NOTES                                                 *doit-notes*

Project Notes adds project-specific notes functionality to Do-It.nvim, inspired by 
maple.nvim. This feature allows you to maintain separate notes for each project
while working in Neovim, making it easy to document project-specific information 
and thoughts without leaving your editor.

Features:
- Project-specific notes that follow your Git repository or working directory
- Global notes mode for system-wide documentation
- Easy switching between global and project modes
- Persistent storage of notes in JSON format
- Markdown highlighting for better readability
- Floating window interface consistent with other Do-It.nvim components

Project Notes is designed to complement your to-do workflow:
- Store project-specific documentation alongside your to-dos
- Document implementation details, decisions, and references
- Keep track of project-related thoughts and ideas
- Use markdown formatting for better organization

The notes are automatically saved when:
- The notes window is closed
- You switch between global and project modes
- You navigate away from the buffer

TMUX INTEGRATION                                           *doit-tmux*

Do-It.nvim includes full tmux integration, allowing you to manage todos
from within tmux without opening Neovim. Both interfaces share the same
data, so changes sync automatically.

Features:
- Full CRUD operations via fzf-based interactive manager
- Quick actions (toggle, start next) without leaving your workflow
- Status bar integration showing current todo
- Multiple list support with shared session state

Quick Start:~
Add to ~/.tmux.conf with TPM: >tmux
    set -g @plugin 'bearded-giant/do-it.nvim'
<

Key bindings use prefix + d as the menu key:
    prefix + d + i     Interactive manager (full features)
    prefix + d + t     Quick popup viewer
    prefix + d + x     Toggle current todo

For complete tmux documentation, see |doit_tmux.txt|
