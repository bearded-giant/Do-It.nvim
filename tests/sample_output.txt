## Summary of test results:

- **tags_spec.lua**: 5 tests passed, 0 failed
- **sorting_spec.lua**: 6 tests passed, 0 failed
- **todos_spec.lua**: 8 tests passed, 0 failed
- **doit_spec.lua**: 4 tests passed, 0 failed, 1 pending
- **main_window_spec.lua**: 5 tests passed, 0 failed
- **search_window_spec.lua**: 4 tests passed, 0 failed
- **storage_spec.lua**: 4 tests passed, 0 failed

**Total: 36 tests passed, 0 failed, 1 pending**

The "pending" test is not a failure - it means the test was skipped because a feature is not implemented yet.

## Understanding the error-like messages

The messages like these are NOT test failures:

```
Testing file access with: /data/test_write.txt
❌ Failed to write test file
❌ Todos file not found or cannot be opened
Loading todos from: /data/doit_todos.json
❌ Could not open todos file for reading
```

These are debug output from init.lua in the Docker container that's trying to access files in /data directory. 
The Docker container intentionally has limited file access to keep tests isolated.
